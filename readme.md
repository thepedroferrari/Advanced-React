# Advanced React + GraphQL

I am building a store with today's best frontend/backend tools.

I am using:

- **React**: The building block
- **GraphQL**: Express/GraphQL server for implementing Query and Mutation Resolvers
- **NextJS**: Server side rendering, routing and tooling
- **Styled Components**: Styling the cleanest way possible
- **Apollo**: Data management, caching, managing local state, error and Loading UI states (replaces the need for Redux + data fetching/caching libraries)
- **React-Apollo**: interfacing with Apollo Client
- **GraphQL Yoga**: An express server for implementing query and mutation resolvers, custom server side logic, charging credit cards, sending email, performing JWT Auth, checking permissions
- **Prisma**: A GraphQL database interface
